### A smart lock system using an LCD and a keypad user interface.

- The user can choose a password of any size
- The password can be changed in two ways:
	- By pressing the button in the Tiva launchpad board the user is prompted to enter the old password and the new password
	- By reprogramming the microcontroller   



#### The software could be extended for any application by changing the behaviour of those two function
- A function "correct_message" gets called when the entered password is correct
- A function "incorrect_message" gets called when the entered password is incorrect
